## _The Prince Experience_

#### _Prince Rogers Nelson Music Recommendation App_

#### By _**Shane Stafford**_

### Description
Prince Rogers Nelson was the modern day Mozart. A master of composition, production, performance and over 20 instruments, Prince reached musical heights few others have. With 39 studio albums to his name, not to mention countless bootlegs and unreleased “vault” recordings, Prince left a legacy that will last centuries beyond his brief time on Earth.

However, with so much content to sort through, how can music fans new to Prince know where to begin? Answering that question is the purpose of The Prince Experience, as we connect you with songs and albums from Prince’s catalog that match your musical interests. Simply select a genre of music you enjoy, and you’ll receive a customized Prince playlist and album recommendations so you can begin to experience Prince.
